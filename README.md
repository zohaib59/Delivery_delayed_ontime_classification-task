# Delivery Delay Prediction with ML â€“ End-to-End Benchmarking

This project builds a robust ML pipeline for predicting delivery delays using real-world logistics data. It includes preprocessing, outlier handling, feature engineering, 
and benchmarking across 12 supervised learning algorithms.
Predicting Delivery Delays with Machine Learning â€” A Real-World Benchmark.

Logistics firms can plug this into their ops to reduce SLA breaches and optimize routing.
